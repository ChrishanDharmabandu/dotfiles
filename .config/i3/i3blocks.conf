# For the middle part (workspace numbers), i3blocks doesn't directly control the middle
# of the bar. Workspace numbers are handled by i3status or i3bar itself.
# To achieve "window numbers in the middle ontop," you'll typically configure i3bar
# in your i3 config file (~/.config/i3/config) to position the workspace module centrally.
#
# Here's an example of how your i3 config might look for the bar section:

# bar {
#   status_command i3blocks
#   position top
#   font pango:monospace 8
#
#   # This is where you configure the workspace output to be centered.
#   # The actual centering depends on the i3bar's capabilities and theme.
#   # i3bar generally handles workspace numbering automatically.
#   # For truly "in the middle ontop", you might need to use a custom script
#   # for i3status or another bar like Polybar.
#   # However, i3bar does a decent job of centering the workspace numbers
#   # when it's the only content in that section.
#   workspace_buttons yes
#   mode dock
# }
